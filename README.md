# ucl-audio-delay-detection


## Description 

This project was developped to help UCL Neuroscience department to automate measures of delay in audio recording of patients suffering from stuttering. 
These measures are used to evaluate patient's progresses and therapeutical protocoles. It was realised in collaboration with Yasser Barona for the **StreamLit** user interface. 

## Installation 

Conceived as a micro-service WebApp, no installation is requirred. 


## How to Use

Go to [this address](https://tonyanciaux-ucl-audio-delay-detection-app-1jt9de.streamlit.app/)
Then input the audio files you wish to process. You have the option to input a unique file or a batch of files. 
Once sent, the files will be processed and the program will generate the results in a csv file you can easly download and use at your convenience.
